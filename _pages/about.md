 I have been a data scientist at Adobe since 2017, where I have tried to do both “researchy” and “analytics” style work in Data Science/Statistics, as well as production ML Engineering. My general career goal is to know enough theory to understand research papers in Stats & ML, and to understand enough engineering to implement or architect such algorithms in production systems. I hope that this blog can have a similar theory + engineering vibe.

The content of the blog will hopeully live at the intersection of “things I’ve worked on (recommender systems, real time ad-ranking style contextual bandits, A/B testing etc.), and “things I’m interested in” (some stats papers, maybe new programming languages like Rust, and of course, Generative AI…). Expect to see a lot of Python, and some Scala and Java (and maybe some comparisons of these!)

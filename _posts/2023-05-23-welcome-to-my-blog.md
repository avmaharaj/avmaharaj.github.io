Welcome to my blog - a random walk through Data Science, ML Engineering, and perhaps a few other topics. 

This is my first post, and it represents my first foray into blogging. I'm trying to follow the advice of several people I admire - [Xavier Amatriain](https://amatriain.net/blog/whyIpost), [Rachel Thomas](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045), and [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) to name a few. I am inspired by [lots](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/#) of [excellent](https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/) blogs, and can only hope to reach the [technical depth](https://lilianweng.github.io/) and [clarity](https://wrongbutuseful.substack.com/) of my industry peers. 

A bit about me: I have been a data scientist at Adobe since 2017, where I have tried to do both "researchy" and "analytics" style work in Data Science/Statistics, as well as production ML Engineering. My general career goal is to know enough theory to understand research papers in Stats & ML, and to understand enough engineering to implement or architect such algorithms in production systems. I hope that this blog can have a similar theory + engineering vibe.  

The content of the blog will hopeully live at the intersection of "things I've worked on (recommender systems, real time ad-ranking style contextual bandits, A/B testing etc.), and "things I'm interested in" (some stats papers, maybe new programming languages like Rust, and of course, Generative AI...). Expect to see a lot of Python, and some Scala and Java (and maybe some comparisons of these!)

Before this current incarnation, I was a physicist, working on Theoretical Condensed Matter (basically - attempting to understand interesting materials at low temperatures, like superconductors). Yes - I sometimes miss the purity of pursuing fundamental questions and the excitement and satisfaction of learning new ideas. But thankfully, working in Data Science lets you read enough research papers to remind you of academia, while writing code provides a much shorter time-to-satifaction cycle! 

Ok - that's a long enough first post, and hopefully this is as self-indulgent as they're going to be! Thanks for reading, and hope you enjoy future posts!
